### Finding a Purpose

One of the people who most inspires me is certainly, Jay Shetty. I like to say that he is my mental mentor. I learned a lot from him. So as him, I know several people with sucessfull jobs, sucessfull careers, beautifull partners, and so as him, i saw a sense of lack of fulfillment, meaning and purpose in their lives. And I always been an observer. After the internership in Altice, and saw those people who is five/ten years older than me, I ask myself.

> "Is that the life I want?"
> "Is that where I want to be?"

If you are in a company, in a school, doensn't matter, then look at the person who's twenty years ahead of you and ask yourself again : "Is that where I want to be?"

If the answer is 'No' then you need to find a new path. And my answer at that time, for observing, was 'No'. The path that my parents or society or the university I went to or the community had that was carving out for me - it didn't feel like the path for me.

I'm almost finished the University, and it's time to seeking my own path. For me, and should be for everyone, the first step is just opening yourself up to new experiences and new role models.

If we do not consciously decide how we want to live, we will inevitably create a life to live up to the expectations that the people have for us. - Fred Canto e Castro
There's this beautifull quote, that the Jay Shetty often says, but was not him who wrote it, was a philosopher and writer named Cooley, and he said that

> Today, I'm not what I think I am, I'm not what you think I am, I am what I think you think I am. - Colley"

So, we live in this perception of a perception of ourselfs. My identity is made by what my parents think I should be. My identity is made up by what my university thinks i should achieve. While you're living in that bubble, getting to what you really want to do is impossible, because maybe that just doesn't fit. And I think so many people feel that way today. That they don't fit into the current society system.

So, that process of self-actualization, first requires being exposed.

You can't be what you can't see. If I never saw a google software enginnering, I would've never be a google software enginnering, or if i never meet a Natural Leader, I wouldn't want to be one, because I wouldn't know what that feels like, I don't know what that looks like, I don't know what it takes.

And I think that's the biggest challenge of our society: **That we're not exposed**.

**Thank you, to the incredible people that I have in my life.**
