### Jay was named in the Forbes 30 Under 30

Influencer in the world of Media. Jay’s daily show HuffPost Live #FollowTheReader, where he interviewed the likes of Russell Brand, Tim Ferriss and Deepak Chopra reached 1 million people daily. Jay aims to share knowledge at the pace we want entertainment, something he likes to call “making wisdom go viral.” He has created content for and partnered with Snapchat, Facebook, National Geographic, Nasdaq and HuffPost to name a few.

Born and raised in London, Jay was a shy, introverted young boy who always strived to make a positive difference. As a child he was bullied for being overweight and a little nerdy but he never let these experiences affect him. Like any teenager, Jay spent most of those years experimenting with what the world had to offer. Tired of being simply “good”, Jay’s thrill seeking ventures saw him get suspended from school on multiple occasions as he tried to find his identity. He lost two of his best friends when he was 16, one in a car accident and the other due to gang violence. These tragic events really made him reflect on what a blessing life is and he felt the need to find deeper purpose and meaning.
