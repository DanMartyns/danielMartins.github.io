## About

<p>My name is Daniel Martins. I have a master's degree in computer engineering and telematics from the University of Aveiro, Portugal. </p>

<p> If I were to describe myself in one word, I would say "endless". I never stop thinking about how to be a better person for myself and for others. 
As a monk named Dandapani says 
</br>
<b>"Never chase happiness. Pursue a lifestyle in which the product of that lifestyle is happiness" </b>
</br>
and that is what I look for myself. Being able to work on something that feels good and happy to do. I love meeting new people and places and building 
a life full of experiences and good memories. </p>

<p>I want to become a person that everyone can count on. I want to become, what I call a "natural leader", someone who grows while helping others to grow, 
someone who does what is right for people, someone who never gives up, and someone who wants to see every end of the day the smile on people's faces.</p>
