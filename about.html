## About

My name is Daniel Martins. I have a master's degree in computer engineering and telematics from the University of Aveiro, Portugal. I am passionate about the world, and my curiosity is endless regarding knowing the world, meeting people and most importantly, knowing everything that makes me grow as a person, and as a professional. I don't refuse opportunities that can take me out of my comfort zone as long as those opportunities make me better. I love my family and I will always do my best to give the best to my family. I love people with ideas out of the box, but who are aware of reality. I get bored with a monotonous life and so I always like to try new things.
